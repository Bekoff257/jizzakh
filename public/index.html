                            and the present city is built of the site of the town which belonged <br> 
                            to Osrushana. After the Arab conquest of Sogdiana, Jizzakh served <br>
                            as a market town between the nomadic raiders and settled farmers. <br>
                            The Arabs built a series of rabats (blockhouses) at Jizzakh, housing <br>
